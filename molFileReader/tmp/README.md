# molFileReader
Python Molecule reader for .xyz, .gro, and .qcin (Q-Chem input). This library can import the coordinates, nuclei, names, etc. to be used in your python code. Multiple molecule frames are also allowed for each molecule type, with .qcin using "fragments" as opposed to frames.

Very much a work in progress!
